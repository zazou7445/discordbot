# Multiserver Moderation Bot
This bot allows for Moderation actions within discord server networks. It is developed in a way to allow adding extra commands through either command files (Like Lockyz Modular Bot) or adding commands by hard coding them into the index.js file.

# Please Note
At this current time all it will be able to do is log moderation actions in a seperate server. Things like multi-server banning/kicking is gonna come later.
